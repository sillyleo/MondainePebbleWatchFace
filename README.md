# Swiss Square

"Swiss Square" watchface for pebble.

Modified from "Mondaine Watchface for Pebble" by https://github.com/limjohnny88/MondainePebbleWatchFace

Updated setting panel with help from zszen https://github.com/zszen/pebble_zswisssquare

I made following changes:

1. Remove the official Mindaine logo to avoid copyright issues.
2. Make it square.
3. Slightly adjusted hour/second hands for better clarity.

Enjoy.
